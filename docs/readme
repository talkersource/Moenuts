Simple Quick Startup For Moenuts v1.72pr.

If you've gotten this far, you've untar'd the code into it's
directory, I'll assume the default directory of moenuts172/
in your Linux/Unix shell account.

To build the talker using the defaults, change to the soruce
directory, (cd ~/moenuts172/source) and type ./compile

This will build your talker's executable called "moenuts172"

Now, once it's done type:   cd ..
Then type:  ./moenuts172

And that's it.  The talker will be booted on port 9666

If you wish to change this port, cd into the datafiles
directory and edit the config file with your favorite
text editor such as nano, or pico or vi..

Enjoy.
