                  -= LICENCE AGREEMENT (Updated: 05/15/2004) =-
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using this software is subject to the following agreements and
restrictions.  Please read and make sure you understand them before using
this software.  Alot of time and effort by Michael Irving, Moesoft
developments with the help of others went into making this Talker Server
happen, and we'd like to be able to keep up the development of this.


1... This licence agreement may be updated without notice.  The latest
     We reserve the right to update this agreement without notification in
     any way we see fit.

2... No user shall remove code from the product in question for the
     purpose of using it in another product/code without the
     written concent of Michael Irving.  Keep in mind, we do
     release usefull code snippets on our FTP site, and you never know,
     the code you're looking for must might be there anyways:).

3... All copyright notices MUST remain intact.  No one person shall modify
     the .version or .help credits in any way.  These must remain as they
     are.  No one person shall remove any of the names on the 'Special
     Thanks To' role call in the credits.  These people have been kind
     enough to donate their time and/or services and/or knowledge to help
     make this project better, and must not be removed from the list.

4... No one person using the Moenuts Chat Server may update it and call it
     their own.  We don't have a problem with you saying something like:
     Talker Name v2.2.2 running Moenuts v1.59 or whatever.  As long as the
     Moenuts and the original NUTS version identifiers are left intact.
     It's very disturbing to see talker owners that run codes calling it
     their own code when all they did was modified a couple prompts and/or
     added a couple commands and say they wrote it.  There has been alot
     of work put into Moenuts from the original NUTS 3.3.3 release, not
     just a couple of commands or prompt changes.

5... No one person shall use any of our products for the purpose
     of making a profit off of it.  We don't make any money from it, so
     neither should you.  You may, however use the software to run a
     Pay-Per-Use system as long as it's not for commercial purposes.
     Commercial use is subject to a special agreement.  Please contact
     support@moenuts.com for more information.

6... Our products are distributed under their own agreements and are
     NOT released under the GNU licence agreement, nor are PUBLIC DOMAIN!
     Our products are either released under a Freeware agreement or a
     Shareware agreement (Specified in the documentation of each product).

7... Legal action can and may be persued against anyone ignoreing or

     Moesoft Developments.
