	 			* SEX *

     Everybody who has a dog calls him Rover or Boy. I call mine Sex. Now
Sex has been embarrassing to me. When I went to City Hall to renew his dog
license, I told the clerk I would like to have a license for Sex. He said,
"I would like to have one too." Then I said, "But this is a dog." He said he
didn't care what she looked like. Then I said, "You don't understand, I've
had Sex since I was 9 years old!!" He said, "You must have been quite a kid".

     When I got married and went on my honeymoon, I took the dog with me. I
told the motel clerk that I wanted a room for Sex. He said that every room in
the place was for sex. I said, "You don't understand, Sex keeps me awake at
night!" Then the clerk said, "Me too."

     One day I entered Sex in a contest, but before the competition began the
dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just standing there,
looking around. I told him that I had planned to have Sex in the contest. He
told me I should have sold my own tickets. "But you don't understand" I said,
"I had planned to have Sex on T.V." He  called me a show off. When my wife
and I separated we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said,
"Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married!!" The Judge said, "Me too". Then
I told him that after I was married that Sex had left me. He said "Me too".
Last night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking around town for him. A
cop came over to me and asked me what I was doing in the alley at 4 O'clock
in the morning. I said looking for Sex. My case comes up Monday........
