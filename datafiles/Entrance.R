You walk in the room and everyone stops and stares.  You feel like a
thousand eyes are stareing at you.  All of a sudden, you hear someone
whisper.  Is that $N ?  Is it really them?  What is $N doing
here?  Suddenly someone comes upto you and pats you on the back...
$N !  How ya been buddy?  So glad you came to join the party!
Grab yourself a seat!  Stay a while and enjoy the fun!
