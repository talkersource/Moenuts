Subject: Welcome To Our New Talker!

-=[ This is an auto-message from the new talker Chat Server ]=-

We, the staff of the new talker Telnet Chat server, would like to take this
opportunity to welcome you to our little family.  The telnet chat server is
an all ages talker, and we welcome one and all.  Although this talker is
considered 'all ages', we do ask that you use discression, and be aware
that there may be, from time to time, more mature subjects being discussed.  
We ask that if anything you read makes you feel uncomforatble, that you
talk to one of our staff members about it.

We're currently running a version of 'Neils Unix Talker Server' which has
been severely updated, and has been renamed to 'Moenuts' and we are
currently running version 1.53 which also includes some games for your
enjoyment, including Poker, Craps, Tic Tac Toe and Hangman.  We hope to
have more games in the future like Black Jack, Connect Four, Chess and
others.

If you should have any questions about the talker, and/or any concerns,
please feel free to email us at mytalker@myhost.com, or send 'smail' on
the talker to 'moe' and he'll be glad to answer any questions you might
have.

Breif note, *ALL* commands start with a period (.), for example, to send
smail to someone on the talker, use .smail <username> or to get a list of
who's on the talker, you'd use  .who  and if you would like a list of
commands, use .help, and for an explaination of the command, use .help
<command name>

We're glad you decided to check our talker out, and hope you enjoy
yourself and have many happy returns! :)

- The Owners.
