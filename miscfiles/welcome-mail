** General Help **

Although some talkers are different in the way they opperate, must, if not
all Moenuts talkers will give you a list of commands when you type .help
although the system operators may have changed this, but this is unlikely.

To get help on a specific command if it exists, type: .help <command>
For example:  .help examine  to get help on how you use the 'examine'
command.

There is various items that may be set, and to do so, you can type:
.set by itself to see the settings menu.

To see which staff members are on the talker, you may type .management

Please remember, all commands may be abreviated, and that commands begin
with either a period (.) or a coma (,).
